                    The Prakasam Barrage, built across the Krishna River in
                    Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, is both an important irrigation
                    structure and a road bridge. The original barrage was
                    constructed in 1855 by the British, and the present
                    structure was completed in 1957, named after Tanguturi
                    Prakasam Pantulu, the first Chief Minister of Andhra State.
                    Stretching about 1.2 km in length, it supplies water to
                    nearly 1.2 million acres of farmland in Krishna, Guntur, and
                    surrounding districts. It also forms a beautiful backdrop
                    for the city, especially when its gates are open, and in
                    2023, it was recognized as a World Heritage Irrigation
                    Structure.

                    temples dedicated to Goddess Durga. According to legend,
                    Goddess Kanaka Durga appeared here to protect the people
                    from the demon Mahishasura. The temple offers a stunning
